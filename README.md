# PMnet: Learning of Disentangled Pose and Movement for Unsupervised Motion Retargeting
Tensorflow implementation of paper:

[PMnet: Learning of Disentangled Pose and Movement for Unsupervised Motion Retargeting](https://bmvc2019.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/0997-paper.pdf) (BMVC 2019)

# Environments
* Python 2.7

* Tensorflow 1.3.0

* Blender 2.79 (for visualizing character animations)

Our implementation is based on the code for the CVPR 2018 paper (Neural Kinematics Networks for Unsupervised Motion Retargeting) by Ruben Villegas, Jimei Yang, Duygu Ceylan and Honglak Lee.

Please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/rubenvillegas/cvpr2018nkn) for further details.
